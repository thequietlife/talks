Abstract

⛈️ Have you reached a point in your career where you were just over it? For me I got frustrated with creating reports and then having them changed from amber to green so the Board would not freak out, writing documents that were approved but then filed away.

🔭 I realised I needed to make a change. Learn some deep technical skills. Become an expert in a niche area.
Around this time I had a colleague who was a Cyber Security champion.

🌟 Learn how you can help someone make a career jump and land softly. 😺 And it doesn’t take a lot of effort.
